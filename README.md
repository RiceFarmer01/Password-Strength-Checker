# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python application that uses Tkinter to create a graphical interface for checking the strength of a given password. The application calculates the password's entropy and classifies its strength based on the entropy value.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Run `python password_strength_checker.py` to launch the application.
4. Enter your password in the input field.
5. The application will display the entropy and strength of the entered password.
6. You can also generate a random password by specifying character length and choosing whether to use symbols or mixed case.
